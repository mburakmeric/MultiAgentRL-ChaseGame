## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced concepts in multi-agent reinforcement learning, game theory, and software engineering. The Chase Game features three agents competing on a dynamic 15x15 grid:

- **Runner (R)**: Attempts to survive and avoid capture

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### Environment Specifications

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Grid Size** | 15×15 | Game board dimensions |
| **Obstacles** | 5 | Randomly placed barriers |
| **Max Turns** | 300 | Game time limit |
| **Agents** | 3 | Runner + 2 Chasers |

### Observation Space
```python
{
    "board": np.ndarray(shape=(15, 15), dtype=int),  # 0=empty, 1=obstacle, 2=runner, 3=c1, 4=c2
    "runner_pos": tuple(int, int),                   # (x, y) coordinates
    "chaser1_pos": tuple(int, int),                  # (x, y) coordinates  
    "chaser2_pos": tuple(int, int)                   # (x, y) coordinates
}
```

### Action Space
```python
# Discrete(5) for each agent
actions = {
    0: "UP",
    1: "DOWN", 
    2: "LEFT",
    3: "RIGHT",
    4: "STAY"  # Only when no valid moves available
}
```

### Victory Conditions

#### 🏃 Runner Wins
- Survives all 300 turns without being caught
- Gets completely surrounded (no escape possible)

#### 🔍 Chasers Win  
- Any chaser occupies the same cell as the runner
- Cooperative hunting strategies emerge through training

### Reward Structure

| Agent | Condition | Reward |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Runner** | Wins game | +1.0 |
| **Runner** | Gets caught | -1.0 |
| **Runner** | Per turn | 0.0 |
| **Chaser** | Catches runner | +1.0 |
| **Chaser** | Other outcomes | 0.0 |

## 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Details

### Training Architecture

The project implements **independent agent training** where each agent learns separately:

1. **Chaser1 Training**: Runner and Chaser2 use fixed policies (random/pretrained)
2. **Chaser2 Training**: Runner and Chaser1 use fixed policies  
3. **Runner Training**: Both chasers use trained/random policies

This approach ensures:
- ✅ Autonomous decision-making for each agent
- ✅ No communication dependencies between agents
- ✅ Emergent cooperative behaviors through environment interaction

### Algorithms Used

- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: Stable policy gradient method
- **DQN (Deep Q-Network)**: Value-based learning for discrete actions
- **A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)**: Fast training with good performance

### Training Features

- **Curriculum Learning**: Progressive difficulty increase
- **Action Masking**: Only valid moves considered during training
- **Experience Replay**: Efficient sample utilization
- **TensorBoard Integration**: Real-time training monitoring
- **Model Checkpointing**: Automatic saving of best performing models

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Custom Agent Development

```python
from agent_policies import BaseAgent
import numpy as np

class SmartChaser(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__(name)
        
    def decide_move(self, observation, legal_moves):
        """Implement custom chase strategy"""
        board = observation["board"]
        runner_pos = observation["runner_pos"]
        my_pos = observation[f"{self.name}_pos"]
        
        # Calculate distance to runner
        distances = []
        for move in legal_moves:
            new_pos = self.calculate_new_position(my_pos, move)
            distance = abs(new_pos[0] - runner_pos[0]) + abs(new_pos[1] - runner_pos[1])
            distances.append(distance)
        
        # Choose move that minimizes distance to runner
        best_move_idx = np.argmin(distances)
        return legal_moves[best_move_idx]
```

### Environment Customization

```python
from cgame_env import ChaseGameEnv

# Custom environment parameters
env = ChaseGameEnv(
    grid_size=20,          # Larger board
    num_obstacles=8,       # More obstacles
    max_turns=500,         # Longer games
    seed=123              # Reproducible setup
)
```

        # Use action mask for valid actions
        action_mask = info.get("action_mask")
        if action_mask is not None:
            legal_actions = np.where(action_mask)[0]
            action = np.random.choice(legal_actions)
        else:
            action = env.action_space(agent).sample()
    
    env.step(action)
```

## Swapping Agent Policies

The modular design allows easy swapping of agent behaviors:

```python
from board_state import BoardState
from agent_policies import RandomAgent, ManualAgent, BaseAgent

# Create custom agent
class SmartChaser(BaseAgent):
    def decide_move(self, observation, legal_moves):
        # Your custom logic here
        board = observation["board"]
        runner_pos = observation["runner_pos"]
        my_pos = observation[f"{self.name}_pos"]
        
        # Example: move towards runner
        # ... implement chase logic ...
        
        return chosen_action

# Use in CLI game
# Modify cli_game.py to import and use your custom agent
```

## Environment Details

### Observation Space
```python
{
    "board": 15x15 numpy array (0=empty, 1=obstacle, 2=runner, 3=chaser1, 4=chaser2),
    "runner_pos": (x, y),
    "chaser1_pos": (x, y),
    "chaser2_pos": (x, y)
}
```

### Action Space
- Discrete(5): [0=Up, 1=Down, 2=Left, 3=Right, 4=Stay]

### Rewards
- Runner: +1 for winning, -1 if caught, 0 otherwise
- Chasers: +1 for catching runner, 0 otherwise

### Info Dictionary
```python
{
    "turn_number": int,
    "legal_moves": list of valid actions,
    "win_condition": "runner_win" | "chaser_win" | None,
    "action_mask": binary array of legal actions
}
```

## Manual Controls

When playing with `--runner manual` or `--chaser manual`:
- **U**: Move up
- **D**: Move down
- **L**: Move left
- **R**: Move right
- **S**: Stay (only when no other moves available)

## Development

To extend or modify the game:

1. **New Agent Types**: Inherit from `BaseAgent` in `agent_policies.py`
2. **Board Modifications**: Edit `BoardState` in `board_state.py`
3. **Rendering Changes**: Modify functions in `utils.py`
4. **RL Training**: Use the `ChaseGameEnv` with standard RL libraries

## Reproducibility

All random elements (agent spawning, obstacle placement) support fixed seeds:

```bash
# Command line
python cli_game.py --seed 123

# In code
env = ChaseGameEnv(seed=123)
```

## Current Status

- ✅ Core game engine complete
- ✅ PettingZoo environment implementation
- ✅ Two CLI interfaces (standard and interactive)
- ✅ RL training pipeline with Stable-Baselines3
- ✅ Autonomous agent architecture (each chaser independent)
- 🔄 Neural network integration into CLI (future work)
- 🔄 Tournament system for agent comparison (future work)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter training errors:
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install stable-baselines3 supersuit tensorboard`
- Check Python version compatibility (3.8+ recommended)
- Verify CUDA setup if using GPU acceleration
- See training logs in `training/logs/` for detailed error messages
