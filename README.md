## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### Environment Specifications

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Grid Size** | 15×15 | Game board dimensions |
| **Obstacles** | 5 | Randomly placed barriers |
| **Max Turns** | 300 | Game time limit |
| **Agents** | 3 | Runner + 2 Chasers |

### Observation Space
```python
{
    "board": np.ndarray(shape=(15, 15), dtype=int),  # 0=empty, 1=obstacle, 2=runner, 3=c1, 4=c2
    "runner_pos": tuple(int, int),                   # (x, y) coordinates
    "chaser1_pos": tuple(int, int),                  # (x, y) coordinates  
    "chaser2_pos": tuple(int, int)                   # (x, y) coordinates
}
```

### Action Space
```python
# Discrete(5) for each agent
actions = {
    0: "UP",
    1: "DOWN", 
    2: "LEFT",
    3: "RIGHT",
    4: "STAY"  # Only when no valid moves available
}
```

### Victory Conditions

#### 🏃 Runner Wins
- Survives all 300 turns without being caught
- Gets completely surrounded (no escape possible)

#### 🔍 Chasers Win  
- Any chaser occupies the same cell as the runner
- Cooperative hunting strategies emerge through training

### Reward Structure

| Agent | Condition | Reward |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Runner** | Wins game | +1.0 |
| **Runner** | Gets caught | -1.0 |
| **Runner** | Per turn | 0.0 |
| **Chaser** | Catches runner | +1.0 |
| **Chaser** | Other outcomes | 0.0 |

## 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Details

### Training Architecture

The project implements **independent agent training** where each agent learns separately:

1. **Chaser1 Training**: Runner and Chaser2 use fixed policies (random/pretrained)
2. **Chaser2 Training**: Runner and Chaser1 use fixed policies  
3. **Runner Training**: Both chasers use trained/random policies

This approach ensures:
- ✅ Autonomous decision-making for each agent
- ✅ No communication dependencies between agents
- ✅ Emergent cooperative behaviors through environment interaction

### Algorithms Used

- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: Stable policy gradient method
- **DQN (Deep Q-Network)**: Value-based learning for discrete actions
- **A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)**: Fast training with good performance

### Training Features

- **Curriculum Learning**: Progressive difficulty increase
- **Action Masking**: Only valid moves considered during training
- **Experience Replay**: Efficient sample utilization
- **TensorBoard Integration**: Real-time training monitoring
- **Model Checkpointing**: Automatic saving of best performing models

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Custom Agent Development

```python
from agent_policies import BaseAgent
import numpy as np

class SmartChaser(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__(name)
        
    def decide_move(self, observation, legal_moves):
        """Implement custom chase strategy"""
        board = observation["board"]
        runner_pos = observation["runner_pos"]
        my_pos = observation[f"{self.name}_pos"]
        
        # Calculate distance to runner
        distances = []
        for move in legal_moves:
            new_pos = self.calculate_new_position(my_pos, move)
            distance = abs(new_pos[0] - runner_pos[0]) + abs(new_pos[1] - runner_pos[1])
            distances.append(distance)
        
        # Choose move that minimizes distance to runner
        best_move_idx = np.argmin(distances)
        return legal_moves[best_move_idx]
```

### Environment Customization

```python
from cgame_env import ChaseGameEnv

# Custom environment parameters
env = ChaseGameEnv(
    grid_size=20,          # Larger board
    num_obstacles=8,       # More obstacles
    max_turns=500,         # Longer games
    seed=123              # Reproducible setup
)
```
